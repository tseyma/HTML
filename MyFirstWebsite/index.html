    <p>
        E.T.: THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL, a young boy named Elliott (Henry Thomas
        ) discovers an extraterrestrial being who was left behind when
        his spaceship departed without him. After Elliott brings E.T. home,
        it becomes clear that the benevolent otherworldly creature can't survive in Earth's
        environment and must return to his home planet. While hiding E.T., Elliott develops a close
        friendship with the alien and a connection that binds them to each other. With the help of Elliott, 
        his siblings, and their pals, E.T. sends a rescue message to his planet, but they must face government scientists 
        who want to capture and study E.T. instead of allowing him to return home.
